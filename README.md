# Web Server Framework

I used Express server framewok as it is a flexible Node.js web application framework which provides robust features for web applications. It is server-side JavaScript web development framework built on node.js and Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js is a javascript runtime and uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js package scheme, npm, is the largest open source library.

# Client Framework
 I used jquery as my client framework.jQuery is a JavaScript Library.jQuery greatly simplifies JavaScript programming and is easy to learn. It is a open source framework with huge library.It also suports cross platform and enables building animated applications.

# Implemenation easy
I found implementing the server side easy as i could use the git hub getting started with heroku  [https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction][df1] sample application as the starting point to understand the directory structures and the semantics. 

# Implemenation difficult
I found implementing the client side jquery a bit difficult as it took quite long to understand the syntax and semantics. The extra credit google maps integration with the existing app and displaying markers took time to figure out that the maps initialization was not loading in head tag.

# Deploying to Heroku

Make sure you have Node.js and the Heroku Toolbelt installed.
